"A chance to practice OOD in the context of a real-world example: database access using C#."

Currently have 1, 2, 6 and 7 functions working. The program will run until you input 11 at the next function or initial function prompt. 

Function 3 sends to Data Acces Layer, but does not return due to an Unhandled exception.

Other functions have preparatory code, but never communicate with the data access layer.
